Participants were enthusiastic about the course contents, and particularly interested in the link of using Galaxy workflows for training and teaching. For this workshop we used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://usegalaxy.eu&quot;&gt;European Galaxy server&lt;/a&gt; via their wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas&quot;&gt;Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS)&lt;/a&gt; setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop consisted of two parts, which were separately targeting two groups of people: 1) Biomedical &amp;amp; translational medicine researchers/students who are keen on bioinformatics and 2) educators in the “bio” domain who would like to start using Galaxy in their courses as an introduction to Bioinformatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, a series of bioinformatics topics were taught in the Galaxy environment and the application of Galaxy into teaching has triggered interest and good response from the attendees. The follow-up feedback from the attendees is very positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full list of topics covered in this training course can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://galaxy-2018.bioinformatician.science&quot;&gt;the course webpage&lt;/a&gt; and all the training materials are available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.galaxyproject.org&quot;&gt;Galaxy training materials website&lt;/a&gt; (also suitable for self-study!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course was organized by members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dtls.nl/community/interest-groups/galaxy-interest-group/&quot;&gt;DTL Galaxy Interest Group&lt;/a&gt;, more specifically by Chao (Cico) Zhang (VU), Sanne Abeln (VU), Anton Feenstra (VU), Saskia Hiltemann (ErasmusMC), Mateusz Kuzak (DTL) and Celia van Gelder (DTL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big &lt;em&gt;thank you!&lt;/em&gt; to the GalaxyEU team for providing the TIaaS service; it saved us a lot of time in preparation, and everything ran very smoothly on the day, and the team were on standby throughout the workshop to help in case we encountered any issues, it was a big factor in the success of the workshop, thanks a lot!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="training" /><category term="tiaas" /><summary type="html">An ELIXIR-NL training course entitled Bioinformatics for Translational Medicine using Galaxy: see it, do it, teach it! was held on October 17 - 19, 2018 in Amsterdam.

  &lt;p&gt;Die Analyse teils mühselig erhobener Daten geben Forscher nur ungern aus der Hand. Doch in Zeiten von Big Data kann genau diese Aufgabe einen in IT weniger versierten Lebenswissenschaftler an seine Grenzen bringen. Hochkomplexe Programme ohne Informatikkenntnisse selbst anwenden? Der neue Galaxy Europe Server macht das nun möglich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Galaxy administrator, you can use it to do things like viewing the queue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this week, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://usegalaxy.eu/freiburg/&quot;&gt;Freiburg Galaxy Team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ie-freiburg.mpg.de/bioinformaticsfac&quot;&gt;Bionformatics facility from the MPI-IE Freiburg&lt;/a&gt; offered an introductory course to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data using Galaxy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monday 17th: HTS and Galaxy presentations and introduction by Thomas Manke and Björn Grüning, with the help of Mehmet Tekman&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuesday 18th: Quality control, Mapping, ChIP-seq analysis by Bérénice Batut and Leily Rabbani, with the help of Devon Ryan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wednesday 19th: RNA-seq analysis by Anika Erxleben and Bérénice Batut, with the help of Pavan Videm and Mehmet Tekman&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thursday 20nd: HiC data analysis by Ralf Gilsbach and Joachim Wolff, with the help of Björn Grüning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friday 21st: Exercises &amp;amp; discussion with Björn Grüning and Mehmet Tekman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Master students, 16 PhD students, 5 Post-docs and 2 PIs participated to this workshop. The feedback we received is good: 100% of the participants though it was good to excellent and will recommend it and 96% will use Galaxy for future projects. A sucessful week then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt; Human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVECs) are involved in the pathogenesis of
retinopathy of prematurity. In this study, the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of
HRMVECs were investigated under resting conditions, angiogenic stimulation (VEGF treatment) and anti-VEGF treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/strong&gt; The miRNA profiles of HRMVECs under resting and angiogenic conditions (VEGF treatment),
as well as after addition of aflibercept, bevacizumab or ranibizumab were evaluated by analyzing the transcriptome
of small non-coding RNAs. Differentially expressed miRNAs were validated using qPCR and classified using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; Ten miRNAs were found to be significantly changed more than 2-fold. Seven of these miRNAs were
changed between resting conditions and angiogenic stimulation. Four of these miRNAs (miR-139-5p/-3p and miR-335-5p/-3p) were validated by qPCR in independent experiments and 
were found to be associated with angiogenesis and cell migration in Gene Ontology analysis. In addition, analysis of the most abundant miRNAs in the HRMVEC miRNome (representing 
at least 1% of the miRNome) was conducted and identified miR-21-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-100-5p and miR-126-5p/-3p to be differently expressed by at least 15% between resting 
conditions and angiogenic conditions. These miRNAs were found to be associated with apoptotic signaling, regulation of kinase activity, intracellular signal transduction, cell 
surface receptor signaling and positive regulation of cell differentiation in Gene Ontology analysis. No differentially regulated miRNAs between angiogenic stimulation and 
angiogenic stimulation plus anti-VEGF treatment were identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; In this study we characterized the miRNA profile of HRMVECs under resting, angiogenic and anti-angiogenic conditions and identified several miRNAs of potential 
pathophysiologic importance for angioproliferative retinal diseases. Our results have implications for possible miRNA-targeted angiomodulatory approaches in diseases like 
diabetic retinopathy or retinopathy of prematurity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="paper" /><summary type="html">Johanna M.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zebrafish embryo is mostly transcriptionally quiescent during the first 10 cell cycles,
until the main wave of Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) occurs, accompanied by fast chromatin remodeling.
At ZGA, homologs of mammalian stem cell transcription factors (TFs) Pou5f3, Nanog and Sox19b
bind to thousands of developmental enhancers to initiate transcription. So far, how these
TFs influence chromatin dynamics at ZGA has remained unresolved. To address this question,
we analyzed nucleosome positions in wild-type and Maternal-Zygotic (MZ) mutants for pou5f3
and nanog by MNase-seq. We show that Nanog, Sox19b, and Pou5f3 bind to the High Nucleosome
Affinity Regions (HNARs). HNARs are spanning over 600 bp, featuring high in vivo and
predicted in vitro nucleosome occupancy and high predicted propeller twist DNA shape value.
We suggest a two-step nucleosome destabilization-depletion model, where the same intrinsic
DNA properties of HNAR promote both high nucleosome occupancy and differential binding of
TFs. In the first step, already prior to ZGA, Pou5f3 and Nanog destabilize nucleosomes on
HNAR centers genome-wide. In the second step, post-ZGA, Nanog, Pou5f3, and SoxB1 maintain
open chromatin state on the subset of HNARs, acting synergistically. Nanog binds to the
HNAR center, while the Pou5f3 stabilizes the flanks. The HNAR model will provide a useful
tool for genome regulatory studies in the variety of biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I need a tool that:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reads two files (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I need to pick out random lines from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;but it should ignore lines in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/code&gt;.
And the number of random lines to be picked should be equal to the number of lines in the subset file.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Two example files are attached:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;abcd
bcde
cdef
defg
efgh
fghi
ghij
hijk
ijkl
jklm
klmn
lmno
mnop
nopq
opqr
pqrs
qrst
rstu
stuv
tuvw
uvwx
vwxy
wxyz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/code&gt; (is a subset of the parent file):&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hijk
ijkl
jklm
opqr
pqrs
qrst
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any idea how to solve that? It is possible with the normal Galaxy tools :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We proposed the following solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_easyjoin_tool/&quot;&gt;“Join two files”&lt;/a&gt;
  to filter out the lines that are in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/code&gt; file &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; file. You should have now a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; file without those line from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_sort_header_tool/&quot;&gt;“Sort”&lt;/a&gt;
  the new file with the option &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Random order (-R)&lt;/code&gt;. Sort has indeed a random sorting option, somehow unintuitive - but useful.&lt;br /&gt;
  Now we have a random sorted file without the unwanted lines. What needs to be done is to extract N lines, where N is the length of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=addValue&quot;&gt;“Add column to an existing dataset”&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iterate&lt;/code&gt; option enabled. This you need to do
  for both files the initial &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/code&gt; file and the new random sorted partent from step 2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now use &lt;a href=&quot;https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_easyjoin_tool/&quot;&gt;“Join two files”&lt;/a&gt;
  again, but this time on the newly created datasets with the additional column. This will give you exactly N lines where N is the amount of
  lines in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Optional) If needed, remove the additional column with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_cut_tool/1.1.0&quot;&gt;Cut tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

an elective master course &lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Genomics&lt;/strong&gt; which included several hands-on sessions on the Galaxy platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lectures in this course were open to everyone and soon after the hands-on sessions 
started, several PhD students joined the 8 master students attending the course. During the classes we worked on RNA-seq analyses and variant calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students were interested and deeply engaged. In the end, this first generation completed the course

We had noticed that a
filesystem was extremely slow around 2 days ago, and had updated our Galaxy
configuration to work around this. Unfortunately we failed to restart the
handlers so new datasets continued to be written to that path, until the point
at which it became an emergency and the system became completely unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cleared the queue in order to allow us to restart the handlers,
unfortunately we did not have a way to re-schedule the jobs we had to kill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re sorry for any inconvenience this has caused, this should be a one-time
issue. Please restart your jobs at your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

It was originally developed to assist High Energy Physics (HEP) collaborations to deploy software on the worldwide-distributed computing infrastructure used to run data processing applications.
The Galaxy project is using the same technology now to distribute 6TB of reference data and Singularity images to the scientific community.
This will make analysis more reproducible across Galaxy instances as the reference data is also shared. However, the provided data can be used without Galaxy and for example
will be available inside the de.NBI cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/cvmfs-example&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CVMFS example repository&lt;/a&gt; and learn how to use the data and images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are proud to announce a new CVMFS mirror under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://cvmfs1-ufr0.galaxyproject.eu/cvmfs/@fqrn@&lt;/code&gt;.
This will make this service more sustainable and failure-tolerant to our entire community.&lt;/p&gt;

DESCRIPTION:<strong>Galaxy-ELIXIR Webinar Series: FAIR data and Open Infrastructures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>\n\nThe Galaxy Community and ELIXIR organise a webinar series to demonstrate how open software and public research infrastructures can be used in analysing and publishing SARS-CoV2 data.\n\n<h2 id="session-3-cheminformatics-screening-of-the-main-protease">Session 3: Cheminformatics: Screening of the main protease</h2>14 May 2020, <strong>17.00-18.00 CEST</strong> (starts at <strong>16.00 BST</strong>, <strong>11.00 EDT</strong>, <strong>8.00 PDT</strong>)\n\nThis session will present the <a href="https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/cheminformatics/">Galaxy workflow to identify candidate molecules for COVID-19 drug treatment, using molecular docking simulation</a>, which predict which molecules are most likely to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 main protein.\n\nThe computationally intensive workflow was executed through a distributed compute network available via the Galaxy Europe platform. The webinar will present methods and workflows forthe identification of potential COVID-19 drug candidates. Special emphasis will be given to the complex methods that have been applied and that have consumed more than 25 CPU and GPU years for this tasks.\n\n<a href="https://elixir-europe.org/events/webinar-galaxy-elixir-covid19">Programme Information and Registration</a>\n\n<h3 id="speakers-to-be-decided">Speakers To Be Decided</h3>

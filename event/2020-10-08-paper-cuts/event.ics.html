DESCRIPTION:Paper cuts are annoying but easy to fix bugs. We plan to have a one-day contribution fest, dedicated to reducing Paper cuts in Galaxy and its ecosystem. It will be a <strong>24-hours event to span all time zones</strong> with our worldwide community.\n\nPlease save the date! It’s an ideal opportunity for newcomers to get started. And remember it’s still <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>!\n\n

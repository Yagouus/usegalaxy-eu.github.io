DESCRIPTION:Learn about Galaxy and how to compose and execute repeatable and reproducible modelling workflow with FATES for improving climate models.\n\nFATES is a numerical terrestrial ecosystem model for use in Earth System Models (ESM) that simulates and predicts growth, death, and regeneration of plants and subsequent tree size distributions. Participants will learn about climate modelling as well as how to use the Galaxy Climate JupyterLab for running FATES experiments and compare those with observational data.\n\nThis is an informal and interactive event with type-along type of presentations, live coding, and demos. Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises. <strong>Go ahead and <a href="https://nordicesmhub.github.io/2020-10-26-galaxy-fates/">register</a>!</strong>\n\n
